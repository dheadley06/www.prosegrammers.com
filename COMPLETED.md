the `slides/weekone/index.qmd` file.
- [X] Note that the existing content was from slides that Gregory M. Kapfhammer
previously created to introduce a course in the field of algorithm analysis. You
should revise all the technical content in these slides to fit into a course
about document engineering. However, you should also use this content in these
slides as good examples for what your generated slides should look like. Make
sure to use similar formatting, layout, and content as the provided slides.
- [X] The slides that introduce the course should contain Python source code
like that which you found in the `index.qmd` file in the root of the repository.
Make sure that students can run this source code and see the output.
- [X] After finishing the slides that introduce the course, create more slides
that introduce the following technologies and explain how to install them:
    - Terminal window
    - Git, GitHub, and GitHub CLI (i.e., `gh`)
    - Register for a free GitHub Student Developer Pack
    - Register for the free use of GitHub Copilot at the pro level
    - VS Code
    - `uv` (stress the use of `uv` for virtual environments, dependencies, and
    Python installation, especially focusing on the fact that a learner
    should not use alternative mechanisms for installing Python or any of
    the other aforementioned tasks like creating virtual environments)
    - Python 3.12 or 3.13 (which should come from using the `uv` tool)
    - Quarto
    - Quarto extension for VS Code

tools clearly explain what the tool does, why it is important, and how it can
help a prosegrammer to create, maintain, and analyze documents.
- [X] Ensure that the instructions for installing each of the aforementioned
tools stress the importance of testing the setup to make sure that they are
working. There should be links to online documentation that a learner can read
if they have trouble installing or testing any of the tools.
- [X] Add content about the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI)
coding and writing tools that use large language models (LLMs) like Claude
Sonnet 4 or GPT-4. Make it clear that the prosegrammer who uses these tools is

to write Markdown to the Markdown files that they write to document their own
document engineering projects, where they are building tools that input
and process and analyze text documents in JSON, YAML, Markdown, and plaintext.

italic text) and then show how that actually renders. This means that the
student should be able to look at the slide and see both the source code and the
rendered output.

#### Python Dictionaries for Document Engineering

- Dictionaries are Python's implementation of hash tables, providing O(1)
average-case lookup time for key-value pairs, making them ideal for document
indexing and metadata storage
- The dictionary data structure maps keys to values, mirroring real-world
document organization systems like catalogs, indexes, and bibliographic
databases
- Python dictionaries maintain insertion order (as of Python 3.7+), enabling
predictable iteration through document collections while preserving fast
lookups
- Dictionary comprehensions and methods like `get()`, `items()`, `keys()`,
and `values()` provide efficient document processing operations

#### JSON and Dictionary Interoperability

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is defined by RFC 8259 and serves as the
standard data interchange format for web APIs and configuration files
- Python's `json` module in the standard library enables seamless conversion
between JSON strings and Python dictionaries using `json.loads()` and
`json.dumps()`
- JSON's object notation directly maps to Python dictionaries, with JSON
arrays becoming Python lists and nested objects becoming nested dictionaries
- Modern document management systems extensively use JSON for metadata
storage, configuration files, and API communication

#### Dictionary Operations for Document Management

- Key existence checking with `in` operator provides O(1) average-case
performance, enabling efficient document verification in catalogs
- Dictionary `update()` method merges multiple document collections,
supporting aggregation workflows common in document management systems
- The `del` statement and `pop()` method enable safe removal of document
entries from catalogs and indexes
- Iterating through `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` provides flexible
access patterns for document processing pipelines

#### Nested Dictionaries for Complex Document Structures

- Nested dictionaries model hierarchical document structures like document
catalogs with metadata, sections with subsections, and bibliographic entries
with detailed attributes
- Accessing nested values with bracket notation (`dict[key1][key2]`) provides
clear syntax for retrieving specific document properties
- Complex document schemas benefit from nested dictionary structures that can
represent arbitrary levels of organization
- Type hints like `Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]` document nested structure
expectations and enable static type checking

#### Dictionaries with Varied Value Types

- Python dictionaries support heterogeneous value types, allowing storage of
strings, integers, lists, tuples, sets, and nested dictionaries in the same
container
- Document metadata naturally requires mixed types: strings for titles,
integers for word counts, lists for authors, and dictionaries for nested
properties
- Using lists as dictionary values enables storage of document sections,
version histories, and related file collections
- Using sets as dictionary values automatically deduplicates tags, keywords,
and categories associated with documents

#### Practical Document Engineering Applications

- Word frequency analysis with dictionaries demonstrates fundamental text
processing technique used in search engines and content analysis tools
- Document indexing with inverted indexes (mapping words to document IDs)
enables efficient full-text search functionality
- Metadata filtering and querying operations support document library
management systems used in academic and professional settings
- JSON-based configuration files for document processing tools follow industry
standard practices in software development

#### Educational Slide Design Principles

- Progressive complexity introduction starts with basic dictionary creation
and advances to nested structures and JSON parsing
- Interactive Pyodide code blocks enable hands-on learning and immediate
feedback for dictionary operations
- Concrete document engineering examples connect abstract programming concepts
to practical prosegrammer applications
- Clear slide titles, appropriate icon usage, and incremental content display
support effective learning and presentation quality
