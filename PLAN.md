# Plan for Prosegrammers

## Plan for Content

### Create Slides for Week Nine in `slides/weekten/index.qmd`

- [ ] Review the content in the `GEMINI.md` file (or the `AGENTS.md` file) that
explains the theme of the course on document engineering.
- [ ] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the root of the repository
that explains the idea of a "Prosegrammer" and the concept of document
engineering. All the slides that you create have to specifically connect
to the theme of prosegramming and document engineering.
- [ ] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the `syllabus` directory of
the repository that explains rules and regulations for this course on document
engineering. Note that these are the rules that students follow and not
specifically the rules and regulations that you follow as a coding agent.
- [ ] The new slides that I want you to create should be in the file
`slides/weekten/index.qmd`. The purpose of these slides is to introduce how to
read and write files from the filesystem in Python. The files that will be
input and output are JSON files. I would like you to create all of this
content so that it is about using JSON files for document engineering.

- [ ] Please remember that I am currently working on the slides in
`slides/weekten/index.qmd` that introduce how to use file input and output in
Python. I want the slides to cover these topics:
  - File input and output using the `open()` function
  - Reading and writing files using the `read()` and `write()` methods
  - File input and output using the `Pathlib` module and the `Path` class
  - Using the `json` module to parse and analyze JSON files
  - Reading in a JSON file and parsing it into a dictionary
  - Analyzing the contents of a JSON file that has been parsed into a dictionary
    - Counting the number of keys in the dictionary
    - Accessing values in the dictionary using keys
    - Iterating over the keys and values in the dictionary
    - Counting the min, max, and average count of unique values for
    all the keys and values in the dictionary
  - Creating a dictionary to store the summary data of the counts
  - Writing the summary data dictionary back out to a new JSON file
  - Make sure that you have an initial JSON file that can be input by
  these code examples in the slides. You should create a JSON file that
  contains sample data that can be used for document engineering analysis.
  - Make sure that all work with JSON files uses only packages that are part of
  the standard Python library.
  - Do not use any external libraries when in the code that you implement.
- [ ] You can look at the other slide decks that I have already prepared:
  - `slides/weekone/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weektwo/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekthree/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfour/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfive/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeksix/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekeight/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeknine/index.qmd`
  ... and see how I am currently using Markdown and Quarto in my slides!
- [ ] Please do not use Markdown or Quarto formats that I am not currently using in
my slides to make sure that the content has a consistent format.


- [ ] If you check the `index.qmd` file in this GitHub repository, you can see a
simple example of word frequency analysis. Please use simple examples like this
one to illustrate how to use containers like lists, tuples, and sets in Python.
- [ ] Make sure that all the content is accessible to beginners who do not have
extensive experience with programming or the documentation of a software tool.
- [ ] Make sure that all the content has concrete examples that make points
clear to beginners. Provide simple summaries of the concrete code examples.
