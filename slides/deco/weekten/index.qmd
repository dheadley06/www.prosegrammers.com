# What is Localization? - DJ

## What is localization?
  - Definition: 
    - The process of adapting content, software, or documentation to the
      linguistic, cultural, and technical expectations of a specific locale
      (language + region). This goes beyond translation to include formats,
      examples, legal requirements, and UI/UX adjustments so the material
      appears native to local users.
  - Scope: 
    - translating text and metadata, formatting dates/numbers/currency,
      adapting images and examples, handling plural forms and text direction,
      and ensuring legal and accessibility compliance for the target locale.
  - Goal:
    - Make documentation accurate, usable, and culturally appropriate so
      readers can understand and trust the content without needing to mentally
      translate or adapt it themselves.
  - Examples:
    - translating a user guide to Spanish, switching date formats to
      DD/MM/YYYY, providing RTL layout for Arabic, and localizing screenshots
      and examples with region-specific data.

## Why it matters for documentation

## Localization vs Internationalization

# Why practice localization? - Brandon

## Advantages
  - Wide Market Reach: 
    - Makes software accesible to a variety of users of different languages and cultures increasing potential revenue.
  - Better User Experience:
    - Users can use their prefered language and formats (dates, currency, etc.).
  - Competitive advantage: 
    - Localization can not only give a stronger brand image but can also provide a competitive advantage against other tools that may not have it.


## Core technical challenges
  - Hard-coded strings require signifigant reworking to extract and translate.
  - dates, times, and currencies require specific formatting for different regions.
  - layout and design is a big concern because of some translated text being shorter/longer, Right to left languages can also require fundamental changes.
  - Can be very costly to update and maintain, might need proper translators to make sure translation is as accurate as possible.
